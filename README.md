# Ordering of metabolite concentrations in _E. coli_
This is an ongoing project in which I use an extended version of thermodynamic flux balance analysis to find metabolite pairs, $i,j$, such that:
$$x_i \geq x_j$$
in any steady state of the system, where $x_i$ is the concentration of metabolite $i$.

I'm using data on $\Delta G$ from the equilibrator api.
