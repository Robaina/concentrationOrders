## Some comments
After checking a coupled of predicted ratios with the data from Bennet 2009 I have seen something weird: It seems like the results are completely opposite! That is, when I predict a ratio below 1, the data show a ratio above 1. Could it be that I got the ratios inversed? Or is it a problem with the prediction, perhaps using the pre-defined irreversible reactions, or the simulated experimental conditions.

## MILP failing
So far, the problematic constraints seems to be the dG0 constraint and y being binary. If these are removed, then I get a feasible solution in which the flux vector satisfies the other constraints.
Correction, adding dG0 constraint but keeping y non-binary also fine.

I suspect the problem is with the indices and the ordering of variables. I get ACCOAC to respect the lower bound of 0.07 even with y = 0! and it is an irreversible reaction with dG0. However, ATPM is also irreversible with dG0 but does not respect the lower bound of 3.15. Something is going on with the indices.

## Note
Iterate only over metabolite pairs which are represented in the submatrix generated by reactions with dG0!

Ok, I think I got it. All irreversible reactions with dG0 and with v_min > 0 should have y_irr = 1, this is why ATPM was not getting the minimum of 3.15, because y_irr was set to 0!!

In fact, to diminish the number of binary variables, I would go ahead and identify the active reactions per fva first, and then remove the y_irr from those, since they have to be active.
